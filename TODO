 [*]Parts that have no tests should generate an output file so they don't get 
    rerun

    It should be based on result files, not results held in memory
 [ ]Every vendor should have its own subdirectory
 [ ]remove unneeded parts of testlibrary.py
 [*]cleanup SConstruct
 [ ]Use pickle or database for checksums, so an individual file's checksum can
