    <h2>Connecting the spicelib to libgeda with gedaparts</h2>
    <b>gedaparts</b> is a python script that connects the spice library to libgeda.<p></p>

	    The spicelib is connected to gEDA with a scm script. The
	    script defines how libgeda has to call gedaparts
	    script. The geda-parts.scm script is located in the
	    <i>$INSTALLDIR/share/gEDA/gafrc.d/</i> directory. libgeda
	    calls all scripts inside that directory at startup. <br>
	    There are two command to access the spicelib through the geda-parts.scm:
	    <ul>
	      <li> <b> list command:</b> When calling this command,
	      gedaparts returns a list off all parts inside a given
	      library. The list is extracted out of a given indexfiles.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<b> part command: </b> When calling this command with
		a partname option, gedaparts will lookup that part in
		a additionally given library indexfile. Inside the
		indexfiles is a variable that defines which symbol
		template gets used. The gedapart script combines the
		symbol template and a set of variables to a valid gEDA
		symbol and returns the symbol to libgeda.

    <h2>Downloading the spice models with the Makefile</h2> 

    Some vendors provide spicemodels in the internet. Usually you are
    allowed to use them but your not allowed to distribute them. Thus
    everybody has to maintain his own model library.  To avoid the
    distribution of the model files itself, the spicelib package
    contains all instructions to download and create a local model
    library. <p></p>

    The following steps describe howto create a local model
    library. All steps are inside the toplevel Makefile.<p></p>
    <table>
      <tbody>
	<tr>
	  <td>
	    <img alt="component selector with the spicelib" src="bitmaps/spicelib_creation.png" hspace="20">
	  </td>
	  <td valign="top">
	    <ul>
	      <li> <b>downloading</b> can be done using wget, curl or
	      a similar command line program. If the vendor only
	      provides single modelfiles, it might be necessary to
	      write a more sophisticated crawler script to download
	      the models.
	      </li>
	      <li> <b>unpack: </b> If the vendor provides zip files or
	      tar archives this is the step to extract the files out
	      of it. Sometimes a vendor may even provide zip-files
	      that contain zips and you have to extract the archives
	      multiple times.
	      </li>
	      <li> <b>checksums: </b> The checksums are created to
	      make maintainance of the spice library easier. If you
	      download and extract the spice library archives a second
	      time, you can easily find out which files have been
	      changed by the vendor. You can store that file in and
	      SCM system or create golden checksum files of reviewed
	      models.
	      </li>
	      <li> <b>creating local libraries: </b> The vendor model
	      files are now in a cluttered temporary storage. There
	      are several useless files in that storage and some of
	      the spice files have stupid syntax errors or are
	      incompatible with your circuit simulator. In this step
	      the models are moved to a ordered library structure and
	      the erroneous models can be fixed with patches or other
	      command line tricks.
	      </li>
	      <li> <b> local checksums:</b> The last step is another
	      set of checksums.  This checksums help to detect errors
	      in the above steps. Example: If you fix a model in the
	      previous step the checksum will change. After the change
	      you can manually verify the fix and move the new checksum
	      to your SCM or golden checksum storage.
	      </li>

    <h2>Tests for the spice library and the spice models</h2> 

    The picture below shows how the current test setup works. The
    library tester takes the indexfiles that contain the part
    descriptions.  The tester walks through the index files an runs
    the appropriate test with every part.
    The tester creates a summary htmlfile for each library. <p></p>

    Each test template consists of
    <ul>
      <li> a template schematic </li>
      <li> a script that runs all simulations steps (currently written in python)</li>
      <li> a file with circuit simulation commands either for gnucap or ngspice </li>
      <li> a html template file for the test simulation results </li>
    </ul>
    
    The tester first prepares the test schematic with the current
    part. It copies all required files to the test directory which is
    provided in the head of the library index file. And finally the
    tester executes the tester script. <p></p>
    
    <table>
      <tbody>
	<tr>

	    <img alt="model test overview for the spicelib" src="bitmaps/spicelib_test.png" hspace="20">
	  </td>
	  <td valign="top">
	    The test script runs all commands for one test. e.g. to test a bipolar transistor.
	    <ul>
	      <li> <b>generate netlist:</b> With the gnetlist call,
	      gnetlist gets the parts to test from the spicelib
	      through libgeda and gedaparts. The gnetlist backend
	      spice-sdb takes the netlist and the attributes of the
	      test part. It gets the spice model from the spice model
	      library that is referenced inside the tested part. The
	      output of gnetlist is a spice netlist.
	      </li>
	      <li> <b>run simulation:</b> The test calls the simulator
	      with provided netlist file and the simulation command
	      file. The output of the simulation is on or more data files.
	      </li>
	      <li> <b>post processing:</b> The test script
	      postprocesses the simulation data and creates plot
	      images. As the test script is written in python I can
	      use numpy and matplotlib (pylab) for the testing and
	      plotting actions. Several tests are possible:
		<ul>
		  <li> has the simulator created data files or did the simulation fail?</li>
		  <li> are the simulation results within expected ranges? <br>
		    e.g. saturation voltage should be positive but not larger than 1.0 voltage</li>
		</ul>
	      <li> <b>generate result file:</b> The test result file
	      contains a summary of the simulations. All plots are
	      linked together in a html file. Links to the datasheet,
	      the model files and some additional metadata about the
	      tested parts are inserted too. <br> <b> Note:</b> This
	      file is currently created by the library tester. Thus
	      it's possible to create that file even if the test script
	      crashes.
	      </li>
